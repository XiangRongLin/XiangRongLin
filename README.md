- 👋 Hi, I’m XiangRongLin
- 👀 I’m love working with the cloud ideally with Kotlin
- 🌱 I’m currently writing my bachelors thesis about dynamically creating a microservice environment in order to allow non-developers to test out changes at an very early stage.
- 💞️ I’m also developing [NovelService](https://novelservice.github.io/), a webservice allowing you to download any number of websites as a single ebook. It is hosted on AWS with free tier resources.
